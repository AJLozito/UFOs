# UFOs


Overview:
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that allowed users to see an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The system tools used were JavaScript and HTML. The goal was to create filters to help the user toggle through data.

Results:
The webpage wouldnâ€™t load, so no conclusion could be drawn. Multiple attempts were made to reevaluate the process, but no progress came to fruition. The expected outcome was not achieved in this project.

Summary:
The major drawback was the inability to make the webpage populate. Maybe this analysis could be conducted with a different tool. Another recommendation is to have a better process to handle the data.
